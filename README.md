This blogging App enables USERS to post POSTS and view/read posts of other users they follow. 
-It enables users to follow each other. 
-It allows logged in users to chat
-It allows logged in users to search posts in real time. 
-ONLY the post owner can perform CRUD operations to his/her posts. 
-The registration process utilizes both front-end validation (enhances user experience) and back-end validation to ensure malicious users don't succeed in their endevours once they compromise the front-end. 
I built the App adhering to Cross Site Forgery (CFS) security and using the very modern 2020 technologies. This work is just to show case my abilities and my stack as a senoir full-stack engineer.
